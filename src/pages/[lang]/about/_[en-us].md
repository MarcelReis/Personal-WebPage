## A short story about me

### How many times would you start over again before you know that you're doing what you love?

I used to study business administration and work with medical billing. Before this, I was an IT support (networks), and before that I was aspiring to be an Electronics Engineer, and before this, I can't quite remember to be honest.

At least every time I started over again, I have gained knowledge, that I still have and use. But every step in this continuous and tedious journey, one thing never left me, programming. Sometimes I automated some dull tasks, or wrote a script to set up a computer or created a bot to spam some WhatsApp groups (funny story).

After realizing that, I tried to explore the world of development, attending numerous meetups across the town. Soon I found web development amazingly challenging and fascinating for me. Then I quit my previous job and started to study Javascript full-time (not the most reasonable thing).

Luckily, after a while, I convince someone to hire me, and I got a phenomenal internship. I started to work with React, Typescript, and, well, jQuery. Since then, I have been a sparkling and curious front end developer, and I enjoy what I am doing at [Letras](https://letras.com).
